<h1>Greetings Traveller!</h1>

<p>
  Welcome to HackTheOxidation's GitHub Pages (now powered by Blazor).<br><br>
  I'm a software engineering master student and free/open-source software enthusiast among other things.<br>
  This site is still under construction at the moment (seriously, when are you ever done with a software project?).<br><br>
  In the mean time, check out my projects on <a href="https://github.com/HackTheOxidation">GitHub</a>.<br>
</p>

<h2>Skills/Interests</h2>

<p>
  Most of the skills that I have acquired primarily come from University and (mostly) free-time hobby coding,
  but in spring of 2022 I got an internship working on a (quite large) python project, so now I also have real-world
  professional developer experience. Yay!
</p>

<h3>Operating Systems</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <b>Linux</b> - I have tinkered with most of the main distros: Debian-/Ubuntu-based, Fedora/RHEL, Arch-based, Gentoo-based.<br>
    And some niche stuff: Artix, GNU Guix, Void Linux, etc.<br> I am currently running Fedora as my main distro.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>BSD</b> - I have also had my hands in some of the BSD-derivatives, mainly FreeBSD and OpenBSD.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Programming Languages and Technologies</h3>

<p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <b>Python</b> - My first internship (which later became my student job) was all about python (django, specifically),
      which means that I have "Professional" python development experience.<br>
      The code I wrote for the 'os2datascanner' project during my internship is fully open source!
      Check it out here: <a href="https://github.com/os2datascanner/os2datascanner">os2datascanner</a>.<br>
      Aside from that, I have used python in non-professional capacity as well,
      mostly in the form of small scripts and config files, but now I am writing
      bindings for my moonalloy project: <a href="https://codeberg.org/HackTheOxidation/python-moonalloy">python-moonalloy</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>HTML & CSS</b> - Used it both professionally and for making this website, but I know that I need to improve (psst! I know they are not programming languages).
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>JavaScript</b> - While it is true that I have written some JavaScript for OS2datascanner in a professional capacity, I don't consider myself that proficient.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>F#</b> - This is really an awesome language and I am beginning to dive deep into this.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>C#</b> - It was taught during my bachelor's at university and now I am writing this GH-page in .NET Blazor.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Rust</b> - I have put a reasonable effort into learning it and I have become quite fond of it.<br>
      I have written a small 'ls'-clone: <a href="https://crates.io/crates/neols">neols (crates.io)</a>.<br>
      I am also working on a numpy-like library written in rust with an API in Python and Lua (still in early development):
      <a href="https://codeberg.org/HackTheOxidation/moonalloy">moonalloy</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Haskell</b> - Being purely functional, this language challenges the way you think and makes you a better programmer (I think?).<br>
      I wrote a few of the challenges from Advent of Code 2021: <a href="https://codeberg.org/HackTheOxidation/advent-of-code2021">advent-of-code2021</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>C++</b> - I know advanced parts of the language from newer standards (C++17/20).<br>
      I wrote a small JSON-parser from scratch: <a href="https://github.com/HackTheOxidation/picoJSON">picoJSON</a>.<br>
      And a library for parsing .INI-files: <a href="https://github.com/HackTheOxidation/libini">libini</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>C</b> - Most of my "experience" come from university and hobby coding.<br>
      I wrote a minimalist web-server for a university project: <a href="https://codeberg.org/HackTheOxidation/ficus">ficus</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Emacs Lisp</b> - It's just cool and retro and I can make my editor do anything with it.
      I have contributed a few lines to <a href="https://github.com/Silex/docker.el">Silex/docker.el</a>
    </li>
  </ul>
